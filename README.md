# Node.js Course - S23 Adding Payments

Practice code for Section 23 - Adding Payments, part of the course "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)" by Academind, Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

This project covers:
- Gained an understanding of Stripe concepts: Checkout Sessions, Payment Intents, client vs server responsibilities and the role of webhooks for payment verification
- Important security takeaway: a client-only "checkout/success" URL is trivial to spoof and must not be used to mark payments as paid
- Decision and rationale:
  - I will **not** implement a quick, easily exploitable Stripe flow in this section just to check a box
  - Stripe is security sensitive and requires server-side session creation and order persistence to be done correctly
  - Implementing a shallow flow now would present an insecure pattern in my repo history and it would look really bad in general
- Planned approach _(to be implemented during or after the **REST API refactor**)_:
  - **Do a rdeep-dive into Stripe docs**
  - Add RESTful payment endpoints (e.g. `POST /api/checkout` and `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`)
  - Create Checkout Sessions on the server only
  - Verify payment results server-side using webhooks before marking orders as paid
  - Handle proper error logging
- Summary:
  - This section demonstrates a general understanding of how Stripe works and documents a secure implementation plan
  - The secure Stripe integration will be implemented after I refactor my project to use a REST API architecture
  - No real / dummy payments are processed in this demo

# How to Run

## 1) Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/S23-Adding-Payments
cd ./S23-Adding-Payments
```

---

## 2) Environment variables

#### 2.1) Copy the example file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
> Note: Recommended and essential environment variable settings are described in `.env.example`

---

## 3) Run the app via Docker (already installed)

#### 1. Make sure your Docker app is running

#### 2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### 3. Start MongoDB with Docker Compose
   ```bash
   npm run db:start
   ```
   - Creates database **`shop`**
> Runs `docker compose up -d`

#### 4. Run the app
```bash
node .\server.js
```

#### 5. Stop the container
   ```bash
   npm run db:down
   ```
> Runs `docker compose down -v`

#### 6. Reset database (remove data + re-run init scripts)
   ```bash
   npm run db:reset
   ```
> Runs `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`

---

## 4) Log in using example credentials

#### 1. Main user
```code
email: test@example.com
password: 123
```

#### 2. Second user
```code
email: foo@bar.com
password: 456
```

---

## Testing DB Connection
A helper script is included to quickly test DB connectivity

```bash
npm run db:test
```
> Runs `node scripts/test-db.js`

<br>Expected output:
```

===== DB connection OK =====

## NPM Scripts

- **`npm start` / `node .\server.js`** → start the Node app
- **`npm run db:test`** → run DB connectivity test (`scripts/test-db.js`)
- **`npm run db:up`** → start MongoDB container
- **`npm run db:down`** → stop MongoDB container
- **`npm run db:reset`** → reset database (drop volume + re-init)

---

## Notes
- `.env` is ignored by Git; only `.env.example` is committed
- If port 3000 is already in use, change the `SERVER_PORT` value in `.env`
- Recommended and essential environment variable settings are described in `.env.example`
- Email functionality will not work out of the box. To enable email sending, you need to create your own SendGrid account and provide an API key + Sender Email in your `.env`
- This section focuses on understanding the fundamentals of Stripe rather than implementing it directly. A proper, secure Stripe integration will be added later once the project is refactored to a REST API architecture. No real / dummy payments are processed in this demo

## IMPORTANT - About `csurf`

<details>
  <summary>My note about csurf deprecation</summary>
  
<br>
<b>I know that <code>csurf</code> has been marked as deprecated.</b>
<br><br>
This Node.js course was created a few years ago using <code>csurf</code>, before the development team deprecated this package. Maximillian explained the general principle of CSRF attacks and used <code>csurf</code> for demonstration purposes.
<br><br>
Since the attacks are only simulated locally in our code and this is a course repository after all <i>(though I put my heart into every single one of them)</i>, I will continue using <code>csurf</code> until I decide otherwise.
